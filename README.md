###  Hangman
>  hangman is a single player game, unlike played with paper and pencil, here we have only one player. We already have some predefined words in the game which you are not aware of.
>  you can use the hint box to guess the word. Each time you play, you will encounter a different word.

###  Tic_Tac_Toe
>  you all know about this game. It is a multiplayer game. Two players can one-by-one select the boxes of their choice to win the game

###  Rock_Paper_Scissors
>  this is also a familiar game. But here it is a single player game. The opponent is the computer. You have to select out of rock, paper and scissor and the computer will do that as well (randomly).
>  so you have to beat the computer instead of your friend.
